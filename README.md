**This bot framework is still under active development, there are still missing features and will likely be breaking changes in the future**

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make creating bots using the jdk framework easier. This is achieved by providing internal modules like Settings, Modules, and Console Logging. It also manages the boilerplate code required to manage a discord bot.

## What is a module?
A module is a piece of code that requires very little boilerplate to create custom functionality for the bot.

## Official Modules
[SayModule](https://github.com/bonn2/SayModule) : Creates a simple to use /say command to make the bot say anything or send embeds.
[RoleManagerModule](https://github.com/bonn2/RoleManagerModule) : Allows you to create role selection menus using discord actions.
[ShowTimeoutModule](https://github.com/bonn2/ShowTimeoutModule) : Give timed out users a custom role
